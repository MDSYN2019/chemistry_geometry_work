// At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. This

// `Box` - a smart pointer used to store data on the heap, which also allows us
// to wrap a recursive type.
//
// The recursive type we're implementing in this exercise is the "cons list", a
// data structure frequently found in functional programming languages. Each
// item in a cons list contains two elements: The value of the current item and
// the next item. The last item is a value called `Nil`.
